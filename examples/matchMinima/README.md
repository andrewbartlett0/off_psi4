# Example of how to match conformers among different QM methods
Last updated: Nov 30 2018  

## Instructions for using `matchMinima.py`

1. Generate input file with [1] specified methods, [2] SDF filenames, and [3] whether or not to use single point energy calculations (True=SPE, False=OPT).
2. Match the molecules between different files.
    * `python ../../../matchMinima.py -i match.in --eplot --tplot --verbose > match.out`
    * Consider requesting an interactive job on the cluster, as this can be pretty intensive.
    * This example has 1 molecule with ~20 conformers geometry optimized with 3 methods. So `matchMinima` will perform a 20x20x20 molecule RMSD comparison.
    * Just the `refA` set took about 5 minutes (see `time.out` file).
    * The `match.out` files in this example have a bunch of numbers output for debugging/refinement. These have since been removed.
3. Plot results of match. Here, we'll read in the pickle file to not waste time re-matching. 
    * `python ../../matchMinima.py -i match.in --readpickle --eplot --tplot`
    * Rename other image files *beforehand* to not be overwritten. [TODO: add detail; circumvent this]
    * Do not specify verbose flag to prevent overwriting dat files. 
    * Can specify either `eplot` or `tplot`, or both.
    * Can finagle plotting options, such as to only plot data from first and third files. To do this, edit matchMinima script:
       * For _time_ plot: edit `to_exclude` variable to exclude specific files. Ex: `to_exclude={1}`
       * For _ene_  plot: edit call to `plotMolMinima` function and specify the parameter for `selected`. Ex: `plotMolMinima(name, minE, thryList, selected=[0,2])`
       * TODO: make this consistent ^
4. Repeat steps 1-2 (step 3 optional) with other methods as reference. The order of the other input files should have the new reference method as the **first** line.
    * For example, compare `refA/match.in`, `refB/match.in`, `refC/match.in`.
    * Have each reference comparison in a separate directory.

## Instructions for using `match_plot.py`

Further analyze matchMinima results by using `match_plot.py` which can generate three kinds of plots:  
(1) RMSE heat plots of all methods compared to all methods,  
(2) time heat plots of all methods compared to all methods, and  
(3) scatter plots of (log) ratio of wall time vs. RMSE using each method as reference.  

1. If you have multiple molecules, create directories for each, such as `mol0`, `mol1`, `mol2`, etc.
    * Only one mol in this example.
2. Generate input file similar to the `matchMinima` input file except that it uses the `dat` files that were output from the `matchMinima.py` script.
    * There should be one input file for each molecule.
    * Doesn't require SPE/OPT specification.
3. Call Python command for each mol. Specify molecule name for plot title and figure name.
    * `python ../../../match_plot.py -i heat.in -t test_mol --theatplot --eheatplot --etscatter`
    * Each one can be called individually (either `--theatplot` or `--eheatplot` or `--etscatter`).
