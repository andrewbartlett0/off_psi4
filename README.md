# Quanformer
README last updated: Oct 04 2018  

Quanformer is a Python-based pipeline for generating conformers, preparing quantum mechanical (QM) calculations, and processing QM results for a set of input molecules. 
This pipeline is robust enough to use with hundreds of conformers per molecule. You will need access to either Psi4 or Turbomole for QM calculations.  

For each molecule, conformers are generated and optimized with the MM94S force field. 
Then input files for QM calculations are prepared for geometry optimizations or single point energy (SPE) calculations.
The user can specify any QM method and basis set that is supported in the QM software package.
After the calculations have finished, this pipeline will extract final energies and geometries as well as collect job-related details such as calculation time and number of optimization steps.
Analysis scripts are provided for comparing conformer energies from different QM methods, comparing calculation times from different methods, and generating nicely-formatted plots.

*Example application*: 
 * Input five molecules and generate conformations for each one.
 * Then run QM geometry optimizations using the MP2/def2-SV(P) level of theory as a relatively quick fine-tuning of the geometries.
 * Take those QM results and run a second geometry optimization stage using the more intensive B3LYP-D3MBJ/def2-TZVP method.
 * Consider questions such as, "What is the spread of the conformer energies for molecule _x_?", "How does method _a_ compare to method _b_ for this molecule?", etc.

In concept, this example would look like:   
`smi2confs.py` &rarr; `confs2psi.py` &rarr; `filterConfs.py` &rarr; \[QM jobs\] &rarr; `filterConfs.py` &rarr; analysis

In practice, the `executor.py` code provides the interface for the various stages and components. 
That being said, each component was written to be able to run independently of the others so variations of this pipeline can be conducted. 
Instructions are provided below for following this example workflow.

## III. Files that are generated throughout the pipeline

SDF files are numbered with the following code system. Let's say the pipeline starts with a file called `basename.smi`  
and contains the list of SMILES strings.
1. The first file generated will be `basename.sdf`. This contains all molecules and all conformers of each molecule.
2. The next file will be `basename-100.sdf`, where `-100` means all molecules have been MM-optimized.
3. Then comes `basename-200.sdf`, in which the MM-optimized molecules are filtered to remove any redundant structures (i.e., duplicate minima).
4. After that is `basename-210.sdf`, which contains the QM-calculated molecules of the `-200` file.
5. The QM molecules are filtered analogously to step 3 to yield `basename-220.sdf`.

This process can go through a second round of QM calculations. QM calculations can be either geometry optimizations or  
single point energy calculations. If the `basename-200.sdf` is fed into both routes, then each route will have its own  
`basename-210.sdf` file. Don't do this in the same directory obviously, else one file will be overwritten. The endmost  
product will be `basename-222.sdf` though one could certainly stop before QM stage 2.

Why bother keeping the `-221` files? They can be used to compare relative energies of single point energy calculations,  
or geometry optimizations, since (mol1,confA) will start from the same structure of the compared files. After filtering,  
the number of conformers may be reduced, so it can be hard to compare one to one.

An `-f` prefix means that the Omega-generated conformers were filtered based on their structures, but that these have not  
been MM-optimized. For example, `basename-f020.sdf` means filtered from OpenEye Omega, no MM opt/filter, yes QM opt/filter, no QM stage 2.

In summary,

 * no suffix = original file with all omega conformers
 * `1xx` = MM opt but no filter
 * `2xx` = MM opt and filter
 * `x1x` = QM opt but no filter
 * `x2x` = QM opt and filter
 * `xx1` = either QM second opt or SPE and no filter
 * `xx2` = either QM second opt or SPE and filter


## IV. Instructions
The instructions below describe how to take a set of molecules from their starting SMILES strings to:
 * Generate conformers
 * MM minimize those conformers using the MMFF94S force field
 * Filter out potentially redundant structures
    * Output: `file-200.sdf`
 * Create Psi4 input files for MP2/def2-SV(P) geometry optimizations
 * Extract results from completed Psi4 jobs
    * Output: `file-210.sdf`
 * Filter out potentially redundant structures
    * Output: `file-220.sdf`
 * Create new Psi4 input files for B3LYP/def2-TZVP geometry optimizations
 * Extract results from completed Psi4 jobs
    * Output: `file-221.sdf`
 * Filter out potentially redundant structures
    * Output: `file-222.sdf`

Before starting, you need an input file (here called `file.smi`) with your list of SMILES strings and molecule titles.
See subsections below on "Naming molecules in the input SMILES file" and "File name limitations".

 1. Generate conformers, perform quick MM optimization, and create Psi4 input files.
    * `python executor.py -f file.smi --setup -m 'mp2' -b 'def2-sv(p)'`

 2. Run Psi4 QM calculations.
    * You can check the geometry during optimization with the `xyzByStep.sh` script in the tools directory.  
      E.g., `xyzByStep.sh 10 output.dat view.xyz`

 3. Get Psi4 results.
    * `python executor.py -f file-200.sdf --results -m 'mp2' -b 'def2-sv(p)'`

 4. In a different directory (e.g., subdirectory), set up Psi4 OPT2 calculations from last results.
    * [for stage 2 OPT]  
      `python executor.py -f file-220.sdf --setup -m 'b3lyp-d3mbj' -b 'def2-tzvp'`
    * [for stage 2 SPE]   
      `python executor.py -f file-220.sdf --setup --spe -m 'b3lyp-d3mbj' -b 'def2-tzvp'`

 5. Run Psi4 jobs.
    * You can check the geometry during optimization with the `xyzByStep.sh` script in the tools directory.  
      E.g., `xyzByStep.sh 10 output.dat view.xyz`

 6. Get Psi4 results from second-level calculations.
    * [for stage 2 OPT]   
      `python executor.py -f file-220.sdf --results -m 'b3lyp-d3mbj' -b 'def2-tzvp'`
    * [for stage 2 SPE]   
      `python executor.py -f file-220.sdf --results --spe -m 'b3lyp-d3mbj' -b 'def2-tzvp'`

 7. Combine results from various job types to calculate model uncertainty.
    * See subsection below on "Creating input file for stitchSpe.py"
    * `python stitchSpe.py -i /path/and/input.dat --barplots`

 8. (opt.) If some mol has a high RMSD, identify the outlying conformer and visualize structure.
    * See `examples` directory.

 9. (opt.) Get wall clock times, num opt steps, relative energies. 
    * `python avgTimeEne.py --relene -f file.sdf -m 'b3lyp-d3mbj' -b 'def2-tzvp'`

### A. File name limitations

Base names (e.g. `basename.smi`, `basename.sdf`) can contain underscores but *no dashes and no dots*.
  * Dashes should not be used in the base filename because this is a delimiter for the SDF numbering code (see above).
  * Dots should not be used in the base filename because this is used to extract the file information such as file extension.
  * Examples:
    * Good: `basename_set1.smi`
    * Bad:  `basename-set1.smi`
    * Bad:  `basename.set1.smi`

### B. Molecule name limitations

Smiles file should contain, in each line: `SMILES_STRING molecule_title` and be named in format of `basename.smi`.
  * Molecule titles are required, as these are used to create subdirectories for the QM jobs. So don't have a space or strange characters in your molecule names.
  * Molecule title should have *no dashes*, as Psi4 will raise an error.
  * Molecule title should *NOT start with a number*, as Psi4 will raise error.
  * Example:
```
CC(C(C(C)O)O)O AlkEthOH_c42
CCCC AlkEthOH_c1008
CCOC(C)(C)C(C)(C)O AlkEthOH_c1178
```

### C. Creating input file for analysis with `stitchSpe.py`

 * This should be a text file directing the script to process a particular quantity.
 * The first uncommented line should be the keyword of the specific quantity (e.g., energy) found in the SD tag label.
 * Following lines should contain the following information in order, separated by a comma:
    * SDF file with full path
    * Boolean: True for SPE values, False for optimization values
    * method
    * basis set
 * The first SDF file listed will be the reference values for all following lines when computing RMSDs.
 * The SDF files on each line should ALL have the same molecules, same conformers, etc. These may differ in coordinates or SD tags.
 * Example:

```
