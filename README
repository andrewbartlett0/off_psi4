 
 The Psi4 Python Pipeline

 01_executor.py - don't do this on head node if lots of confs (tens of thousands)
  1. smi2confs: generate unlimited conformers using oechem.oeomega for an input file with smiles strings.
  2. filterConfs: filter these conformers by RMSD. confs diff in energy skip RMSD comparison and are automatically "unique".
  3. confs2psi: generate Psi4 input files for an SDF file containing all conformers of all molecules.

 02_executor.py - for after QM
  4. getPsiResults: read Psi4 results into original SDF file for confs2psi and write as new SDF file.
  5. filterConfs: (see above)
  6. matchMinima: matches conformers between diff methods, if applicable
